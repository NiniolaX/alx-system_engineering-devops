##0x0F - LOAD BALANCER
This repository contains my code for the Load Balancer (Devops 0x0F) project
for the ALX Software Engineering Programme.

### Project files
In this project, I wrote bash scripts which set up a Load balancer with
two backend servers.
1. 0-custom_http_response_header - Adds a custom Nginx response header to
	backend servers that display the hostname of the server Nginx is
	running on.
2. 1-install_load_balancer - Installs and configures HAproxy on my lb-01
	server.
