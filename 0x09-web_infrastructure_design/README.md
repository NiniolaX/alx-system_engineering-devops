## 0x09 - Web Infrastructure Design
This project covers the design of web infrastructure..
For each task, a list of components (i.e. web server, load balancer, database,
etc.) with which the web infrastructure will be designed is specified.

### Goal of Project
The goal of this project is for me to be able to:
- design a web infrastructure,
- explain what each component of the infrastructure is doing, 
- identify the limitations of the infrastructure, and
- deduce how the infrastructure can be scaled.
