I'm learning shell permissions, this is fun
0-iam_betty, switches current user to user betty
1-who_am_i, prints effective username of the current user
2-groups, prints all groups the current user is a part of
3-new_owner, changes owner of file hello to betty
4-empty, creates an empty file hello
5-execute, adds execute permission to owner of file hello
6-multiple_permissions, adds execute permission to owner and group owners and adds read permission to other users
