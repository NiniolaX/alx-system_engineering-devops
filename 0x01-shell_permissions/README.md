I'm learning shell permissions, this is fun
0-iam_betty, switches current user to user betty
1-who_am_i, prints effective username of the current user
2-groups, prints all groups the current user is a part of
3-new_owner, changes owner of file hello to betty
4-empty, creates an empty file hello
5-execute, adds execute permission to owner of file hello
6-multiple_permissions, adds execute permission to owner and group owners and adds read permission to other users
7-everybody, adds execution permission to owner, group owner and others without commas in the command
8-James_Bond, sets no permission to owner and group owner, and all permissions to others
9-John_Doe, set mode of file hello to -rwxr-x-wx
11-directories_permission, adds execute permission to all subdirectories in the current directory for owner, group owner and others
