## 0x12 - WEB STACK DEBUGGING 2
This repository contains my scripts for the ALX Software Engineering Programme's web stack debugging project.


This project's aim is to familiarize students with managing users in a Linux environment.

### Project Files
1. 0-iamsomeoneelse - Runs the whami command under the user passed as an argument.
2. 1-run_nginx_as_nginx - Fixes an ubuntu container so that nginx is running as the 'nginx' user.
