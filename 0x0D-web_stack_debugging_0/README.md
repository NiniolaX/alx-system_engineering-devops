#0x0D. Web stack debugging
This repository contains my code for the Web Stack Debugging project of the ALX Software Engineering Programme.

###Description
This project aims to train us on the art of debugging.

Broken/bugged tasks were given to us, the final goal of which was to come up with a bash script which once executed, will bring the web stack to a working state.
